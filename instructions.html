        <h3>You're a thrifty, independent college student with expenses and bills to pay! </h2>
        <p>
            To play, you can begin by accessing your tasks in the right-hand menu lab labeled "Tasks". Step through each task
            in order; to start a task, click the "Go" button next to a task. Decide whether to complete the task 
            after evaluating the following information:
            <br>
            <br>
             - How much money will be deducted or earned when completing the task?
            <br>
             - How long will the task take?
            <br>
             - How much happiness results from completing the task?
            <br>
            <br>

            Continue completing tasks while maximizing your budget without running out of time. See how much money you can save, and 
            how many happiness points you can earn!

            Good luck on your budgeting adventure!
